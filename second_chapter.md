# second chapter

the first lesson I learn is to make sure input the correct github Respository
in gitbook setting "github" as below:

GitHub Repository: ï€Š  

Link your book to a GitHub repository to edit this repository directly from the editor.

I input the first repository I create in github "Hello world from SZ"
under my first gitbook"my python learning at github"'s setting.

It confused me for a while. 
when I edit this book,  saw the contents of "hello world from SZ" in github
and synv the edit in this repository but not the same name"my python learning at github" repository.
